## Project Description
For this final project I decided to put hands on a full data analysis. From Data Ingestion to Model training and evaluation. The data ingestion was from the World Bank, more specifically we used economic and financial indicators.

## Workflow
1. Data Ingestion: As mentioned, we used data acquired from the World Bank. Specifically we dived the data ingestion into two: economic indicators and financial indicators. We downloaded almost 30 years of economic and financial information of 210 countries. 
2. Data Wrangling and Cleaning: Althought it was almost "clean" the data. We had to manage the accommodation of the dataset in order to split the data, train and test the model. 
3. Data Exploration and Visualization: For this section, I used the library matplotlib.pyplot and Tableau for other visualizations. 
4. Model Training and Evaluation: Finally, I had and unbalance dataset because of the topic, I had more samples as no-banking crisis, so I had to adjust the dataset using under-sampling and over-sampling. I resume the results with a confusion matrix and a tree-map.
